# DiCE: Dichoptic Contrast Enhancement for VR and Stereo Displays

This is a Matlab code for the technique from the paper:

**Fangcheng Zhong, George Alex Koulieris, George Drettakis, Martin S. Banks, Mathieu Chambe, Fredo Durand, and Rafa≈Ç K. Mantiuk. DiCE: Dichoptic Contrast Enhancement for VR and Stereo Displays. ACM Transactions on Graphics (Proceedings of ACM SIGGRAPH Asia), 2019**

The method enhances perceived contrast in images shown on binocular displays, such as those used in VR/AR. 

More details can be found on the project page: https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/rainbow/projects/dice/

See example.m for usage.

Note that the Matlab code does not compensate for the limited binocular overlap (refer to the paper for the details).
